# multiUseSoftware
A software developed by me alone that aims to show my knowledge on fundamental C++ practices and their implementations.

This C++ software is still in its baby stages but does the trick for the few things I have implemented. I am aware there are plenty of bugs to resolve and I am working constantly to make new & better versions of the program. At the moment it features 3 separate functionalities.
* Reversing a string
* Changing the text color of a string
* Making a list with quantities for given strings that can edit entries after making them

This program features a Data structure in the form of a main.cpp, a header file, and an implementation file. This is my first ever real coding project of this size and caliber so I'm sure it's very crappy and not done the way it's supposed to, but with time I will resolve these issues.

This is open-source, so if you want to scrape it and use it for your own designs, have at it. Just please drop my name in there as a citation as it took me many many hours to even make this basic program.
